<h1> Running the script</h1>
If you have conda setup then proceed with the remainder of this section.
<br />
If you do not have conda you can install it <a href = "https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/">here</a>
<br />
`conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt`.  
This will create a new conda environment with name you gave it and install the requirments we used.
<br />
Next you need to activate the environment you just made so run: `conda activate <name>`.
<br />
After this run the main file: `python main.py`
