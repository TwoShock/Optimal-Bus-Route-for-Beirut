# Running the script
Make sure you have conda setup.<br />
`conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt`.  
This will create a new conda environment with name you gave it and install the requirments we used.
<br />
Next you need to activate the environment you just made so run: `conda activate <name>`.
<br />
After this run the main file: `python main.py`
